## Spruce Haven Farm

I grew up in New York. No, not the city. Most of the state is actually farm land used to feed dairy cows, and my mom's side does just that. We own thousands of acres of land and hundreds of cows that we use to sell dairy products.

I was always riding around in my grandpa's red Chevy Silverado or a John Deere tractor with country music playing on the radio. If that doesn't sound like a country song I don't know what does. I heard the likes of George Strait, Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks, Brooks & Dunn, Tracy Byrd, Billy Ray Cyrus, Shania Twain, and lots more.

## Garropy's Restaurant

On the other hand, my dad's side of the family ran a bar in town, and from what I heard it was **rowdy** back in the day! Music ran in the family and my uncle's band played there on weekends. We spent lots of time at the bar for morning breakfasts, family parties, and pool tournaments. I'd even get behind the bar and make drinks. The Garropy's are a rough bunch but always a good time, and I certainly know where my alcohol tolerance came from.

But our time in New York came to an end when my dad was transferred to Fort Worth, Texas. While I love my New York roots, I got to Texas as fast as I could.

## Nerd Walks Into a Country Bar

Fast forward a few years and I'm at the University of Texas for engineering. I no longer listened to country music, I left that in New York. But thanks to a girl I got dragged to my first country bar: Midnight Rodeo. The minute I walked in I felt at home. The smell of beer, pool tables, and music brought me right back to Garropy's.

That night was also my first Texas country show. Kyle Park was playing and I really liked the Texas style of country music with the fiddle and electric guitar solos. I was hooked on the music, but the dancing changed everything.

## Dancing Changed Everything

I remember leaning on the rail at Midnight Rodeo staring at the two step in total amazement. So I watched a ton of YouTube videos and started going out four nights a week to dance. I danced at Midnight Rodeo and Dallas Night Club, but my home was Rebel's Honky Tonk in downtown Austin, Texas.
