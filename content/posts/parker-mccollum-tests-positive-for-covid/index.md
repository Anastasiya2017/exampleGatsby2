It's tough times for everyone all around. [Parker McCollum][parker] was excited to get back to playing shows in Kansas and Oklahoma when he sat down to breakfast and realized he couldn't smell or taste anything. After visiting the doctor, he tested positive for COVID-19.

This is terrible news to get just as music venues are starting to open up for masked, socially distant shows. Don't worry Parker, you didn't let us down. Focus on your recovery and get well soon, [Daily Texas Country][dtxc] is sending you good vibes.

And once again, [_**#fuck2020**_][2020].
