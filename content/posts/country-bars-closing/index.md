Shortly after [The Railhouse][railhouse] posted this on Facebook, they announced that they were [closing for good][closed]. While I had never been to the venue personally, I have friends in Kyle who loved it. The Railhouse was slowly gaining traction, with bigger artists like [Curtis Grimes][curtis-grimes], [Sam Riggs][sam-riggs], and [Jason Boland][jason-boland] playing shows there.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many restaraunts, bars, and concert venues are struggling to stay open. But even before the coronavirus came around, there's been quite a few country bars closing down.

-   [Midnight Rodeo Austin][midnight-austin]
-   [Midnight Rodeo San Antonio][midnight-sa]
-   [Dallas Night Club][dallas]

Luckily my second home, [Mavericks Dance Hall][mavs], is still going strong thanks to the support of their loyal patrons. If you love this place, consider [donating][donate] to help the bartenders and staff. And if your local country bar is struggling, do what you can to help so we all have a dance floor once this quarantine is over!
