Let's put these whiskey drinkin' and country music listenin' nights to good use. I wish I would have been there at this show at [Cowboys Dancehall][cowboys] back in November 2019. [Parker McCollum][parker] played an unreleased song called _To Be Loved By You_. Here are the lyrics as best as I can tell.

_Capo: 3rd fret_  
_C G D_

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong  
Finding out why shouldn't take this long  
Easier said than done I guess  
I'm a little bit harder to love than the rest  
Why does this have to be so hard  
Doing my best to hold your heart  
And I, I'll never let it go again

So why are you always angry  
Why are you always quiet  
Why do you sleep alone  
When I know you don't like it  
Maybe you might be different  
Care to tell me the truth  
What in the hell does a man have to do  
To be loved by you

Well I've been runnin' as fast as I can  
You never get over what you can't understand  
Pissed off hanging up the telephone  
The river ain't far I'm headed home  
Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong  
Last time you're ever gonna find me gone  
And I, I'll never let it go again

So why are you always angry  
Why are you always quiet  
Why do you sleep alone  
When I know you don't like it  
Maybe you might be different  
Care to tell me the truth  
What in the hell does a man have to do  
To be loved by you

To be loved by you  
To be loved by you  
To be loved by you

So why are you always angry  
Why are you always quiet  
Why do you sleep alone  
When I know you don't like it  
Maybe you might be different  
Care to tell me the truth  
What in the hell does a man have to do  
To be loved by you

To be loved by you  
To be loved by you  
To be loved by you
