## Testing incremental build.

The world is in a crazy place. Coronavirus and this quarantine will go down in the history books. What better way to remember these times than a song?

There have been a few takes on writing a Coronavirus song. [Kyle Park][kyle-park] took a humorous approach on [Kevin Fowler's stream][kevin-fowler] (1:09:00).

But nothing hits home like the song Luke Combs debuted on Facebook called Six Feet Apart. As soon as he sang "I miss my mom, I miss my dad" I knew this song was important for all of us to hear.
