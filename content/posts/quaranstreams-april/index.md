Now that this quarantine thing will be going on [for a while][ny-times], a lot of artists, radio stations, and companies have started hosting livestreams. A single list was getting out of hand so I'll be splitting it up by month until we reach the bar light at the end of the tunnel.

| Date | Stream                           | Artist(s)                   | Type     |

| 4/8  | [Facebook][jason-eady]           | Jason Eady, Courtney Patton | Acoustic |
| 4/3  | [Facebook][curtis-grimes]        | Curtis Grimes               | Acoustic |
| 4/3  | [Facebook][wade-bowen-3]         | Wade Bowen, Jack Ingram     | Acoustic |
| 4/2  | [Facebook][casey-donahew-3]      | Casey Donahew               | Acoustic |

I'll keep this updated as the quarantine continues. If you know of any streams that I missed, tweet them to [@dailytxcountry][twitter] and I'll add them to the list. Now go crack a beer with your friends and tune in!
