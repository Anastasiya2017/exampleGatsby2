[Lone Star Jam][lsj], the festival I love to hate. Don't get me wrong, I attended religiously for many years, but I always thought leaving the LBJ lawn was the beginning of the end.

The venue in 2016 was literally an empty field. And when it rained, the staff wouldn't let anyone leave to put their belongings (like cell phones) in their cars just a few hundred feet away. In 2017 they moved to the Travis County Expo Center, a full hour drive for anyone north of downtown Austin. And finally, starting in 2017 Lone Star Jam was held on Memorial Day weekend, which collides with many other events, like [Whitewater Ampitheater][whitewater]'s big two night show.

But [415 Entertainment][415] did manage to change plans last minute and put together a successful online version of Lone Star Jam. The lineup was relatively small and the event lasted for about an hour. If you've been watching any of the [quaranstreams][quaranstreams] then you already know what to expect, a bunch of solo acoustic performances strung together.

[Kevin Fowler][kevin-fowler]'s performance stole the show, as he played with [Jack Ingram][jack-ingram] from his fully kitted out ranch in Wimberley. This year's Lone Star Jam helped shed some light on two up-and-comers, [Triston Marez][triston-marez] and [William Beckmann][william-beckmann]. Both artists lean towards an older style of country music, which I'm happy to hear.

If you're looking for more of a full virtual concert experience, I'd go check out the [Whiskey Myers show][whiskey-myers] that Billy Bob's hosted a few days ago. Am I happy 415 Entertainment pulled something together in spite of a global pandemic? Yes. But you know what [Jason Boland][jason-boland] says, you get what you pay for and baby I'm free.
