I'll be honest, up until this point I haven't listened to anything from [Muscadine Bloodline][muscadine] since the [Movin' On][movin-on] album. But since quarantine began back in March, the duo has recorded and released 18 songs! Nobody else in the business is working as hard as these guys are.

The majority of these songs come from the [Quarantine Work-Tapes][work-tapes] albums. These albums are basically rough drafts of songs, probably recorded in their homes, and published right from their computer. This style of music production really let's fans see behind the scenes of the song creation process. Here's a good example.

The rest of the songs culminated in a studio recorded EP titled [Turn Back Time][turn-back-time]. To ensure everyone's safety, the album was recorded with only guitar and vocals. The instrumentals give the songs a stripped down sound, a welcome break from some of the over-produced music we're hearing on the radio today.

Because most of the country bands aren't able to tour right now, it's nice to see musicians taking advantage of this time to create music. Besides [Muscadine Bloodline][muscadine], there have been a few other notable releases during quarantine. What's your favorite?
