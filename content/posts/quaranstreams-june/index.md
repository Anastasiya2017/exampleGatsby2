[Last month][may] it was just coronavirus, now we've got police brutality and a race war to worry about?! That's enough to convince me to sit my ass down at home and watch more of these livestreams.

| Date | Stream                     | Artist(s)                              | Type     |
| :--- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------- |
| 6/3  | [Facebook][kevin-fowler-1] | Kevin Fowler, Wade Bowen, Gary P. Nunn | Acoustic |
| 6/1  | [Facebook][stoney-larue-1] | Stoney LaRue                           | Acoustic |

I'll keep this updated as the quarantine continues. If you know of any streams that I missed, tweet them to [@dailytxcountry][twitter] and I'll add them to the list. Now go crack a beer with your friends and tune in!
