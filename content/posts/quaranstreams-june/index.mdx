[Last month][may] it was just coronavirus, now we've got police brutality and a race war to worry about?! That's enough to convince me to sit my ass down at home and watch more of these livestreams.

I'll keep this updated as the quarantine continues. If you know of any streams that I missed, tweet them to [@dailytxcountry][twitter] and I'll add them to the list. Now go crack a beer with your friends and tune in!
